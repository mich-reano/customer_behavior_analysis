# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

# Data Analytics | Customer Insights | E-commerce Intelligence

This project provides an in-depth analysis of customer shopping behavior based on a transactional dataset of 3,900 purchases. The aim is to uncover key patterns in demographics, purchasing habits, product performance, discount sensitivity, and subscription behavior. The results offer actionable recommendations for improving customer retention, optimizing pricing strategies, enhancing product assortment, and boosting overall revenue performance.

## Project Overview

Modern e-commerce platforms generate massive amounts of data from customer interactions. This project analyzes structured purchase data to answer essential business questions such as:

- Which customer segments contribute most to revenue?
- How do discounts influence customer behavior?
- Which products perform best and why?
- Are subscribers more valuable than non-subscribers?
- How does shipping preference relate to order value?
What opportunities exist for improving marketing, pricing, or retention strategies?

The analysis emphasizes insights over code, focusing on understanding behavior that drives purchasing decisions.

# Key Insights
##  High-Value Customer Segments

A small percentage of customers (loyal + high-frequency buyers) contribute a disproportionate share of total revenue.

The Young Adult age group are the most lucrative and should be central to targeted marketing.

## Discount Behavior

Some high spenders still heavily use discounts, suggesting they are value-conscious, not low-value customers.

Several SKUs show discount dependency, only selling well during promotions—indicating pricing or visibility issues.

## Subscription Impact

Subscribers consistently show higher Average Order Value (AOV) and purchase frequency.

Subscription has a strong positive correlation with customer retention and long-term value.

## Shipping Preference

Express shipping users demonstrate urgency-driven behavior and significantly higher order values.

Opportunity exists to upsell express shipping or introduce free-express thresholds.

## Product Quality & Ratings

Top-rated products strongly correlate with repeat purchases, confirming product quality as a key retention driver.

Low-rated products show declining trends and may need redesign, better quality control, or improved presentation online.
